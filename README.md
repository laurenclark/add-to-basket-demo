NextJS
React (hooks/functional)

Context API
Custom Hooks
Apollo Client
GraphQL 

I loaded the `fe-test.json` through Hasura into a Postgress DB which then got transformed into a GraphQL schema and API that can be access publicly at [https://vitl-hasura.herokuapp.com/v1/graphql](https://vitl-hasura.herokuapp.com/v1/graphql)

Data payload types should be generated from the GraphQL schema, but there were some out of scope TS issues (üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
